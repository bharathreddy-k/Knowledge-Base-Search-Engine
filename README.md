# 🧠 Knowledge-Base Search Engine

An intelligent **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** application built with **Streamlit** and **OpenAI’s GPT models** that allows users to upload multiple documents (PDF/TXT), search across them semantically, and receive concise, synthesized answers with proper context.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The **Knowledge-Base Search Engine** bridges the gap between static documents and conversational AI.  
Instead of relying on keyword-based searches, it **understands meaning** and **retrieves contextually relevant information** from your documents — delivering precise, citation-backed responses generated by a Large Language Model (LLM).

---

## 🎯 Objective

> To search across multiple documents and generate fact-based, synthesized answers using LLM-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

---

## 🧩 Features

✅ Upload multiple **PDF or TXT** documents  
✅ **Automatic text extraction** and chunking  
✅ **Embeddings generation** using OpenAI’s `text-embedding-3-small`  
✅ **Context retrieval** using cosine similarity  
✅ **Answer generation** using GPT models (`gpt-4o-mini` or `gpt-3.5-turbo`)  
✅ Transparent interface showing **retrieved chunks and citations**  
✅ Fully functional **Streamlit UI**  
✅ **Configurable parameters** – chunk size, overlap, model, temperature, etc.

## 🧱 System Architecture

1. **Document Ingestion:**  
   Users upload PDF/TXT files → text extracted via `PyPDF2`.

2. **Chunking:**  
   Text is split into small overlapping chunks (e.g., 800 chars with 100 overlap).

3. **Embeddings Creation:**  
   Each chunk is converted into a numerical vector using OpenAI’s embedding API.

4. **Query Processing:**  
   User question → embedding → cosine similarity with stored vectors.

5. **Retrieval + Generation:**  
   Top relevant chunks are fed into GPT to synthesize a short, factual answer.

🧪 Example Use Case
Upload multiple PDFs like research papers or reports, and ask questions such as:

“Summarize the objectives of document two.”
“What are the evaluation parameters mentioned in the text?”

The app retrieves the relevant segments and synthesizes an accurate answer with citations.
